AI Pair ProgrammerAn intelligent, real-time coding assistant integrated directly into Visual Studio Code. This tool acts as an AI-powered pair programmer, enhancing developer productivity by providing context-aware suggestions, automated error detection, and intelligent refactoring options.Core Features (Phases 1-3 Complete)Real-time Code Analysis: Send your current Python file to a powerful AI backend with a single command.AST-Powered Context: The analysis is not just text-based. The system uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to give the AI deep, structural context about the code's intent.GraphQL API: Communication between the VS Code extension and the backend is handled by a modern, efficient GraphQL API.Integrated UI: Suggestions and errors are displayed directly in the VS Code editor with native squiggly underlines and hover-over diagnostics, not just in a plain text log.Technology StackComponentTechnologyPurposeClientVS Code Extension (TypeScript)The frontend that lives in the user's editor.Backend ServerPython & FastAPIA high-performance web framework for the API.AI CoreGoogle Gemini API & Python ast moduleThe "brain" that analyzes the code and its structure.API LayerGraphQL (with Strawberry)An efficient and flexible query language for the API.How to Run the ProjectThis project is structured as a monorepo with two main parts: the backend server and the frontend VS Code extension.1. Running the BackendNavigate to the backend directory: cd backendCreate and activate a Python virtual environment:python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
.\.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
Install the required packages:pip install -r requirements.txt 
# (Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file first)
Create a .env file and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY.Run the server: uvicorn main:app --reload2. Running the FrontendNavigate to the frontend extension directory: cd frontend/ai-pair-programmerInstall dependencies: npm installOpen the frontend/ai-pair-programmer folder in a separate VS Code window.Press F5 to start the Extension Development Host.Open a Python file and run the Analyze Code with AI Pair Programmer command from the Command Palette.
